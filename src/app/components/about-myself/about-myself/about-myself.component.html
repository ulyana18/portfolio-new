        it's not a problem for me to communicate with new people. <span class='character'>Creative</span>.
        During developing functionality of my sites I think about the design, from my point of view,
        it's the first thing people pay attention while surfing the Internet.
        <span class='character'>Ambitious</span> and <span class='character'>strong-minded</span>.
